<p class="p3">Please note that third parties may use cookies over which we have no control.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">We may use cookies:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3">to collect anonymized data on users behavior on the site. We may also capture what site a user has come from and what site they go to and also some demographic data (e.g. the user’s location) and we may use that data to analyze user behavior across multiple sites;</li>
<li class="li3">to categorize pools of users (on an anonymized basis) based on demographic and/or behavioral data and use this to target our advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><b>Web Beacons.</b></p>
<p class="p3">We, or our third-party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third-party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Log Files.</b></p>
<p class="p3">In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you access or use the Services, our servers may automatically record certain log file information, including but not limited to your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Services, domain names, landing pages, and pages viewed.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Third-Party Sites and Services.</b></p>
<p class="p3">The Services may reference or provide links to other websites, applications, or resources. If you access any website, application, or resources provided by a third party, our Privacy Policy will not apply. Your interactions with such websites, applications, and resources are subject to the privacy policies of the third parties that operate them. Please review those policies carefully to understand how those parties will treat your information.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>How We Protect Your Information.</b></p>
<p class="p3">We take certain physical, technological and administrative measures to protect the information you provide through the Services against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification. However, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. Email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. You should use caution whenever submitting information online and take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. We cannot guarantee that transmissions of your personal information will be fully secure and that third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or the security measures of our partners. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION DUE TO TRANSMISSION ERRORS, THIRD-PARTY ACCESS OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>USERS OF SITES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA</b></p>
<p class="p3">This section of this Policy applies only if you use the Site from a country that is a Member State of the European Economic Area, and supplements the information in this Policy.</p>
<p class="p6">Users based in the European Union have the following legal rights in respect of their information:</p>
<p class="p6">​</p>
<p class="p7">a. The right to require Mau5trap to confirm whether or not their information is being processed, the purpose of any such processing, the recipients of any information that has been disclosed, the period for which their information is to be stored and whether any automated decision-making processes are used in relation to their information;</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">b. The right to require Mau5trap to rectify inaccurate information without undue delay;</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">c. The right to request the erasure of their information. Subject to certain conditions, Mau5trap may be required to erase the information in response to such request where: (i) the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected, such as where a user chooses to terminate his or her use of the Service; (ii) where the processing of the information is based on the user’s consent, if the user  withdraws his or her consent; or (iii) the user objects to the processing of his or her information and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">d. Where Mau5trap has disclosed the information of a European Union user to a third party and the user requests the erasure or rectification of the data, Mau5trap will take all reasonable steps to inform the third party of such request.</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">e. The right to restrict Mau5trap from processing their information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of that information is disputed or an objection has been raised (see below). In such circumstances, Mau5trap will only process that information with the express consent of the user, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest;</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">f. The right to receive their information from Mau5trap in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format;</p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p7">g. The right to object to the processing of their information by Mau5trap where Mau5trap has relied on the ‘legitimate interest’ basis for processing that information (see ‘Legal Basis for Data Processing’ below), in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the user; or the information is used for direct marketing purposes, in which case we will immediately stop processing the user’s information for such purposes.</p>
<p class="p7">
<p class="p7">h. The right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority of the EU member state where the user resides. The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment.</p>
<p class="p7">​</p>
<p class="p7">i. The above legal rights are subject to various conditions and exceptions including where the data is used for statistical or scientific research purposes and the exercise of the right would prevent such purposes from being attained or would seriously impair their attainment.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Legal Basis for Data Processing.</b></p>
<p class="p3">We process personal data for the purposes set out in this Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the Site); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Site); and based on consent by our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings in emails or on our Sites, <a href="http://privacypolicy.umusic.com/email/default.asp">using this form</a>, or emailing us as set out in the Contact section) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p class="p3">We may use automated decision-making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe may interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with Mau5trap and Mau5trap artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our Sites or interactions with Mau5trap or our third-party partners.</p>
<p class="p3">In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you to use all the features of the Site.</p>
